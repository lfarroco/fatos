# Issues & Work Log

This file tracks issues discovered while implementing the remaining tasks in
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md) and the approved design docs in [docs/design](docs/design).

## [2026-08-13] core — benchmark targets missed for query & datalog join
- **Task**: P0 benchmark (docs/design/04-phasing.md P0)
- **Found by**: core P0 engine work, `npm run benchmark` (packages/core)
- **Severity**: medium
- **Status**: open
- **Description**: 10k entities / 20k facts. ingest avg 84 ms (< 200 ms PASS),
  find by attribute value avg 8 ms (< 10 ms PASS), but single-clause query avg
  30 ms (target < 10 ms, FAIL) and 2-clause datalog join avg 80 ms
  (target < 50 ms, FAIL). Root cause appears to be `candidateEidsForCriteria`
  iterating every EAVT key (O(entities)) plus full entity reconstruction per
  candidate, and the datalog join re-scanning candidates per clause. Per
  04-phasing.md these are "targets to validate, not guarantees" — being routed
  back to a sub-agent for optimization.

## [2026-08-13] repo — `npm run types` fails at root (missing scripts)
- **Task**: P0 hygiene (docs/design/04-phasing.md P0)
- **Found by**: orchestrator baseline check
- **Severity**: medium
- **Status**: fixed
- **Description**: `@fatos/examples` package.json lacks a `types` script, so
  `npm run types` at the repo root aborts with "Missing script: types".
  `@fatos/chrome-extension` also lacks a `types` script. Expected every
  workspace to expose `types` (and `lint`) like the other packages.
- **Resolution**: added `"types": "tsc --noEmit"` to `packages/examples` and
  `packages/chrome-extension` package.json, added `"lint": "eslint src"` to
  `packages/examples`, and added `@types/ws` (missing) to `packages/server`
  devDependencies (ws is a dependency there). Root `npm run types` now exits 0
  for all 9 workspaces.

## [2026-08-13] repo — `eslint src` cannot parse test files (pre-existing)
- **Task**: P0 hygiene (lint scripts exist on every workspace)
- **Found by**: core P0 engine work, lint verification
- **Severity**: low
- **Status**: open
- **Description**: `.eslintrc.json` uses `parserOptions.project` pointing at each
  package's tsconfig, but every tsconfig excludes `**/*.test.ts`/`*.spec.ts`, so
  `eslint src` fails with "Parsing error ... TSConfig does not include this
  file" on every test file in every package. This predates the P0 work and is
  repo-wide; `npm run lint` was already broken before these changes. Fixing it
  requires either excluding test files from the lint glob or a dedicated
  tsconfig for tests (out of scope for P0 engine work).

## [2026-08-13] Workflow note

Remaining tasks are being completed in sequence by spawned sub-agents. After each
step the work is validated (`npm run build`, `npm run types`, `npx vitest run` per
package) and committed. Issues found during validation are logged here and routed
back to sub-agents for fixes.
