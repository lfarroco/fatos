## [2026-08-13] core — benchmark targets missed for query & datalog join
- **Task**: P0 benchmark (docs/design/04-phasing.md P0)
- **Found by**: core P0 engine work, `npm run benchmark` (packages/core)
- **Severity**: medium
- **Status**: fixed
- **Description**: 10k entities / 20k facts. ingest avg 84 ms (< 200 ms PASS),
  find by attribute value avg 8 ms (< 10 ms PASS), but single-clause query avg
  30 ms (target < 10 ms, FAIL) and 2-clause datalog join avg 80 ms
  (target < 50 ms, FAIL). Root cause appears to be `candidateEidsForCriteria`
  iterating every EAVT key (O(entities)) plus full entity reconstruction per
  candidate, and the datalog join re-scanning candidates per clause. Per
  04-phasing.md these are "targets to validate, not guarantees" — being routed
  back to a sub-agent for optimization.
- **Resolution**: rewrote `query()` in core/src/index.ts to use positional
  array bindings (no per-row `Record` spreads), per-binding EAVT index access
  for joins (no per-clause materialization of `(eid, value)` triples plus a
  string-keyed group map), and a non-allocating `hasAttributeValue` check for
  constant-value clauses (replaces the `clauseTriples` scan). Removed the now
  unused `bindTerm`/`clauseTriples`. Added fast-path tests in query.test.ts
  (value-change exclusion, retraction-aware join, many-valued join order,
  cross-variable join order, tx-scoped join). Measured on the P0 benchmark
  (packages/core, 5 runs each): single-clause avg ~7.6 -> ~7.0 ms (best 6.9 ->
  3.9 ms; amortized 3.6 ms/query), 2-clause join avg ~13.6 -> ~10.4 ms
  (amortized 7.4 ms/query). Both targets met: single-clause < 10 ms,
  join < 50 ms.

## [2026-08-13] core — cross-variable datalog joins are narrowed to the candidate intersection (pre-existing)
- **Task**: P0 query engine (fast-path rewrite, `npm run benchmark`)
- **Found by**: query engine optimization work (packages/core)
- **Severity**: low
- **Status**: open
- **Description**: `candidateEidsForQuery` intersects every clause's eid set,
  and the engine iterates that intersection for any clause whose entity
  variable is not yet bound. For a join on two *different* entity variables
  (e.g. `[?a 'type' 'user'] [?b 'age' ?age]`) this restricts `?b` to the
  shared intersection instead of letting it range over all entities matching
  its own clause — narrower than textbook datalog semantics. Preserved
  deliberately for identical observable behavior (pinned in
  query.test.ts "joins two distinct entity variables in candidate order").
  Fixing it (per-clause candidate sets) would change result sets/ordering and
  is out of scope for the P0 optimization.

## [2026-08-13] repo — `npm run types` fails at root (missing scripts)
- **Task**: P0 hygiene (docs/design/04-phasing.md P0)
- **Found by**: orchestrator baseline check
- **Severity**: medium
- **Status**: fixed
- **Description**: `@fatos/examples` package.json lacks a `types` script, so
  `npm run types` at the repo root aborts with "Missing script: types".
  `@fatos/chrome-extension` also lacks a `types` script. Expected every
  workspace to expose `types` (and `lint`) like the other packages.
- **Resolution**: added `"types": "tsc --noEmit"` to `packages/examples` and
  `packages/chrome-extension` package.json, added `"lint": "eslint src"` to
  `packages/examples`, and added `@types/ws` (missing) to `packages/server`
  devDependencies (ws is a dependency there). Root `npm run types` now exits 0
  for all 9 workspaces.

## [2026-08-13] repo — `eslint src` cannot parse test files (pre-existing)
- **Task**: P0 hygiene (lint scripts exist on every workspace)
- **Found by**: core P0 engine work, lint verification
- **Severity**: low
- **Status**: open
- **Description**: `.eslintrc.json` uses `parserOptions.project` pointing at each
  package's tsconfig, but every tsconfig excludes `**/*.test.ts`/`*.spec.ts`, so
  `eslint src` fails with "Parsing error ... TSConfig does not include this
  file" on every test file in every package. This predates the P0 work and is
  repo-wide; `npm run lint` was already broken before these changes. Fixing it
  requires either excluding test files from the lint glob or a dedicated
  tsconfig for tests (out of scope for P0 engine work).

## [2026-08-13] Workflow note

Remaining tasks are being completed in sequence by spawned sub-agents. After each
step the work is validated (`npm run build`, `npm run types`, `npx vitest run` per
package) and committed. Issues found during validation are logged here and routed
back to sub-agents for fixes.
